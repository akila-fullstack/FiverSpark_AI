- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure readability and a modern feel. Provides a neutral canvas for the primary blue to stand out without overwhelming the user.
- Accent color: A contrasting yellow (#FFDA63) to draw attention to call-to-action buttons like the 'Analyze' button and copy buttons, guiding user interaction.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to provide a tech-focused and modern feel, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Crisp, outline-style icons for primary actions (e.g., copy, search). These icons should use the primary blue color (#29ABE2) for emphasis and easy recognition.
- A clean, mobile-first, responsive layout. Use clear sections and white space to organize the input fields, data display, and generated content areas. The 'Analyze' button should be prominently placed.
- Subtle loading animations when analyzing the data, providing user feedback without disrupting the experience. A smooth transition or highlight effect upon generating the title and description.
